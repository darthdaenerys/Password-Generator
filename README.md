# Password Generator

## *Security is one of the most crucial parts of our lives. The importance of security is increasing day by day as most things are going online. Passwords come into light as we talk about security.*

## Why do we need a password generator?

Because we canâ€™t think of different patterns of passwords instantly.
But, it is not the same case with computers. Computers can generate random and strong passwords based on our customizations in seconds. There are many password generators available.

# Features

The best thing about creating our own password generator is that we can customize it as we like.
First, we will create a password generator that asks the strength of the password and generates a random password containing digits, alphabets, or special characters based on its strength.

# Conclusion

We can add as many as we want. But, make sure that the resultant password is strong enough.
Generate the passwords from the code and use them for your next online account!
